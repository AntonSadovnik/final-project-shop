						Sushi was introduced to the West in the early 1900s by Japanese
						immigration after the Meiji Restoration. However, it was not popular
						among the population outside of the upper class, and as Japanese
						immigration declined in the late 1900s, it became much less common.
						Sushi re-emerged a few years after the end of World War II, when
						Japan re-opened to international trade, tourism and business.
						<br />
						To help Europeans get used to the idea of eating sushi, many
						restaurants have begun experimenting with new flavor combinations
						and sushi rolls. One of the most popular rolls was the now
						ubiquitous California roll, which is an inside-out Makizushi roll
						with cucumber, crab meat (or imitation crab meat), and avocado
						topped with white rice.
						<br />

						dishes, sushi lovers do not need to plan a trip to Japan, because in
						the modern world you can simply order a portion of Japanese seafood
